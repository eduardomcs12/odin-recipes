1- Brazilian rice. Rice is a very important part of the Brazilian cuisine and is served at least once a day. The most popular “everyday meal” is rice, beans, beef or chicken, salad and, sometimes, french fries.

2-Farofa. "Farofa" is toasted cassava flour that is paired with almost any meal. Sprinkle it on top of rice, beans, or feijoada.The texture is similar to breadcrumbs and adds a great crunch to any dish. It’s also gluten-free and quick to cook.

3- Passion Fruit Mousse. Known as “mousse de maracujá,” this mousse is thick and creamy due to the sweetened condensed milk and heavy cream. Traditionally, this mousse is served with a passion fruit coulis, which is just sugar, passion fruit juice or pulp, and seeds heated in a saucepan.
