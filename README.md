# Brazilian recipes website

## Description
Small recipe website project testing current HTML skills. Content and lessons will be listed here while project is in progress.

### Contents (recipes)
1- Brazilian rice. Rice is a very important part of the Brazilian cuisine and is served at least once a day. The most popular “everyday meal” is rice, beans, beef or chicken, salad and, sometimes, french fries.

2-Farofa. "Farofa" is toasted cassava flour that is paired with almost any meal. Sprinkle it on top of rice, beans, or feijoada.The texture is similar to breadcrumbs and adds a great crunch to any dish. It’s also gluten-free and quick to cook.

3- Passion Fruit Mousse. Known as “mousse de maracujá,” this mousse is thick and creamy due to the sweetened condensed milk and heavy cream. Traditionally, this mousse is served with a passion fruit coulis, which is just sugar, passion fruit juice or pulp, and seeds heated in a saucepan.

#### Lessons
1- Commit as soon there is meaningful changes and be concise about the commit message.

2- Don't forget to use opening and closing quotation marks when using 'git commit -m' command.

3- Use unordered lists when appending multiple different links so they don't go all on the same line. 

##### CSS

4- (CSS) External CSS seems to be the most useful way to add CSS to HTML since it uses a separate file (a .css archive) containing all the styles to attribute to HTML. To use it, 2 attributes are needed: <link rel> to indicate a relationship between the link and the HTML file and the <href> to use a relative or absolute path of your .css archive.

5- (CSS) Selectors must always contain attributes inside " " which CSS rules will apply later on.

6- (CSS) ID selectors must have an unique attribute.

7- (CSS) Class selectors are able to have multiple classes at the same element separating their names using an whitespace. Multi-worded names must be separated using hyphen (-).
