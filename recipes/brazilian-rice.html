        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Maybe one of the first things we learn how to make in the kitchen is a simple <em>rice</em>. It's just cooking the rice in the water and that's it, right? Yes, but that might be the reason why you don't eat rice more often (at least like me or my fellow brazilians do everyday). Cooking rice is like an art form in some parts of the world, including here. Basically this version of rice is saut√©ed with vegetable oil, onions and garlic, adding a smooth and delicious flavor while cooking.</p>
