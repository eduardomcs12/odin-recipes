        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Maybe one of the first things we learn how to make in the kitchen is a simple <em>rice</em>. It's just cooking the rice in the water and that's it, right? Yes, but that might be the reason why you don't eat rice more often (at least like me or my fellow brazilians do everyday). Cooking rice is like an art form in some parts of the world, including here. Basically this version of rice is sautéed with vegetable oil, onions and garlic, adding a smooth and delicious flavor while cooking.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup of vegetable oil.</li>
                <li>1 cup of white rice, washed.</li>
                <li>2 cups of water.</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced.</li>
                <li>A pinch of salt.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>How to make it?</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>First, wash the rice. You don't need to starch it since you don't want it clumpy in the end. You can use special strainers used for rice, which is common in Brazil, to wash it. Do it until the water runs clear.</li>
                
                <li>When cooking rice, the right proportion of rice to water is 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water. If you keep this in mind, your rice will be flawless and loose.</li>
               
                <li>We boil the water separately (I prefer not to boil the water, you can also use regular temperature water when the next step is finished. <strong>This can save some money on your gas bills</strong>). You can use a tea kettle to boil it while you prepare the rest. </li>
                
                <li>In a large pot (rice gains <em>considerable</em> volume after cooked, so choose something with a room if you don't eat alone), heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil over high heat and, once hot, sauté one finely chopped onion and 3 minced cloves of garlic until translucent. Add the rice and <em>let it fry really well with the onion and garlic.</em>. This process guarantees the unique flavor a loose rice at the end. </li>
                
                <li>When frying, you'll notice the rice browning and forming clumps. This is the cue to add the water (boiling or room temperature as mentioned before). Add a pinch of salt, stir with a spoon, cover and lower the heat to the lowest possible.</li>
                
                <li>Now you'll just need to wait a few minutes, about 15 to 20 until it's ready. A good way to track is when you see holes in the surface, stop hearing the water boil and using a simple fork, gently dig it to see if the pot has dried up. If so, it's ready.</li>
                
                <li>Turn the heat off, partially lift the lid and leave it for about 2-3 minutes and then serve. Now you're ready to get a taste of my homeland! Oh, and the best thing about this rice is it's versatility when used for another recipes like rice cakes, rice with broccoli and so on. Or add accompaniments like our infamous farofa.</li>
