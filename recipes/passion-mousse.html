    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy recipe is made of brazilian passion fruit using only 3 ingredients, also known as <em><strong>mousse de maracuj√°</strong></em>. You can make it within minutes, it doesn't use eggs and is gluten free, making this a nice option for a treat for those with dietary restrictions.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Passion fruit. If you can't get your hands on the fruit itself there's some replacements: <em> (thawed) frozen passion fruit pulp</em> or <em>concentrated passion fruit juice.</em> If you're gonna use the raw fruit, make sure to whisk the pulp in a bowl pass the natural juice through a sieve to separate it from the seeds.</li>
        <li>Sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Whipped cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to make it?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend together <em><strong>sweetened condensed milk, heavy whipping cream and thawed passion fruit pulp</strong></em> in a blender until creamy and thick, for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into ramekins, then cover them, and chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours until the mousse is cold and set. Serve by itself or with a coulis on top.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, you can prepare the passion fruit coulis, if desired (<strong>Follow the next step</strong>).</li>
        <li>To do this, stir half a cup of the thawed passion fruit pulp, 2 tablespoons of sugar and the pulp of one passion fruit in a small saucepan.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, for about 8-10 minutes or until <em>syrupy</em>. Let it cool at room temperature, cover and place in the fridge to serve on top of the passion fruit mousse.</li>
        <li>In case you don't want to make the coulis, you may serve the mousse with <em><strong>berries</strong></em> instead.</li>
        <li><strong>NOTE:</strong>If you prefer to make the mousse with the real pulp of the fruit, make sure to beat it with a whisk or in the mixer (low speed) just enough to extract the juice. Then strain out the seeds and use the strained juice to make the dessert in the blender. Never extract the juice in the blender or else it will become bitter from the seeds being ground up.</li>
    </ol>
